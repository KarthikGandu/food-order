## Introduction

This is a multivendor site, which is an e-commerce platform that allows multiple vendors to sell their products from a single storefront. A multivendor store provides customers with a large catalog to choose from and sellers with a larger base of ready-to-buy customers. The most significant distinction between a multi-vendor marketplace and a standard online store is that the former has the technical capability to handle many sellers. In my project I’m going add all the food court owners as sellers and food items as products.
Vendor registers with multivendor store.

    • Vendor has a dashboard to list and manage his product listings.
    • Whenever a sale happens, store processes the payment and assists
    vendor with packaging as well as shipment.
    • Store owner focuses on growing his base of vendors to grow
    product catalogue.
    • Seller handles both packaging and shipping.
    • Customers can see the tracking of products
    • Customers can be able to save products into cart and put them into
